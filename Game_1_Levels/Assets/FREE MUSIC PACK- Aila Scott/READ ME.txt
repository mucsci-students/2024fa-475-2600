Each of these songs were made for a game jam or small hobby project over the last year or so, as such there's quite a bit of variety between all the tracks.  Here's a table of contents with a brief description:

01- Hamster Haven- A fruity little Club Penguin-inspired tune that's also well suited for puzzle games, light adventure, or menu music

02- It's A Fight- A fast cheezy synth line with big bass, good for retro action and shooter titles

03- Fightwave- "It's a Fight" but slower.  The two work hand in hand.  Pause screen music maybe?

04- Restless Lullaby- A lullaby played on glockenspiel that becomes vaguely unsettling near the end of the loop.

05- Make it Work!-  Made for a discord-themed sorting, vague retro feel

06- Sin & Sensitivity- A lo-fi piece made by key shifting a Bach orchestral suite.  Perfect for historical fantasy, or anything you'd like lo-fi for!

07- eepy- Straight ahead lo-fi

08-Bittersweet Village theme- Soft relaxing piano in a major key.  Good for light adventure or puzzles.

09- A Horrid Discovery- Really really tense and best suited to horror or suspense.

10- Sear The Time Vortex- Metal made for a boss rush game.  Searing guitar solo.  Would also be well suited to fighting or racing games.

11- Dash Thru The Afterworld- Made for the same game as track 10.

12- Silent Ambush-  Orchestral music suited for shooters and mystery games.

13- Solar Winds- Ambient, cosmically horrifying

14- Club Corny- Cheezy dance music for a shooter game dance sequence. Please forget I ever made this.
